Previously, I was an intern at [Sony CSL Paris](https://cslmusicteam.sony.fr/) as part of my Master's program research internship.

I have a bachelors in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Computer Engineering from [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/), Brazil. I also have a masters in Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision from [Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay](https://www.ens-paris-saclay.fr/), France and an engineering degree from [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), France.


I am currently working on topics ranging from music source separation using synthesis, signal processing informed deep learning and differentiable digital signal processing. I am generally interested in audio signal processing, machine learning and the crossroads between the two.
