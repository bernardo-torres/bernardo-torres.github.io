# Bio

I am currently a first year PhD student at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/),  working under the supervision of prof. [GaÃ«l Richard](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/gael-richard) and prof. [Geoffroy Peeters](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gpeeters/). I am part of the [ADASP](https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/) group and the [HI-Audio](https://hi-audio.imt.fr/) project.

Previously, I was an intern at [Sony CSL Paris](https://cslmusicteam.sony.fr/) as part of my Master's program research internship.

I have a bachelors in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Computer Engineering from [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/), Brazil. I also have a masters in Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision from [Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay](https://www.ens-paris-saclay.fr/), France and an engineering degree from [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), France.


I am currently working on topics ranging from music source separation using synthesis, signal processing informed deep learning and differentiable digital signal processing. I am generally interested in audio signal processing, machine learning and the crossroads between the two. 

I have also taken a particular interest recently in contemplative practices, especially meditation, and philosophy.
