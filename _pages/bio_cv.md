# Bio

Hello! I am a PhD student at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/),  working under the supervision of prof. [GaÃ«l Richard](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/gael-richard) and prof. [Geoffroy Peeters](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gpeeters/), part of the [ADASP](https://adasp.telecom-paris.fr/) group and the [HI-Audio](https://hi-audio.imt.fr/) project.

Previously, I was an intern at [Sony CSL Paris](https://cslmusicteam.sony.fr/) as part of my Master's program research internship.

My academic path has taken me from a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Computer Engineering at [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/) in Brazil to an engineering degree in France, from [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/). In 2022, I also graduated with a Master's degree from the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) program in Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at [Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay](https://www.ens-paris-saclay.fr/), France.

I am currently working on topics ranging from music source separation using synthesis, signal processing informed deep learning and differentiable digital signal processing. I am generally interested in audio signal processing, machine learning and the crossroads between the two, but my broader research interests include self-supervised learning, music information retrieval, timbre, optimal transport and generative models.

Outside the lab, I've recently developed an interest in contemplative practices, particularly meditation, and philosophy.
